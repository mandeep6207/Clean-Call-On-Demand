### Community‑Driven Smart Garbage Collection System

**Smart Swachh** is a hackathon‑ready civic‑tech web platform designed to improve garbage collection in Indian cities. Instead of fixed or random schedules, garbage trucks are dispatched **only when a ward is actually ready**, based on real‑time citizen participation.

This project focuses on **strong UI/UX, real‑world feasibility, and social impact**, making it ideal for college‑level hackathons.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In many Indian cities, garbage collection follows **unpredictable schedules**:

* Garbage trucks arrive randomly
* Citizens miss pickups
* Waste piles up in local areas
* No transparency or accountability exists

There is no **demand‑based system** that reflects actual garbage readiness at the ward level.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Smart Swachh introduces a **community‑driven, demand‑based garbage collection system** where:

* Citizens mark when their garbage is ready
* The system calculates ward readiness in real time
* Garbage trucks are scheduled only when a defined threshold is reached
* Truck movement is visualized like delivery apps
* Citizens receive alerts when trucks approach

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🌍 Ward‑Based System

* City → Ward → Area structure
* Real‑time garbage readiness tracking
* Transparent ward‑level statistics

### 🗳️ Garbage Readiness Voting

* One‑tap **“My Garbage is Ready”** button
* One vote per household
* Prevents spam and unnecessary pickups

### 📊 Smart Threshold Logic

* Garbage truck is scheduled only when readiness crosses a threshold
* Designed to adapt to real‑world usage

### 🚚 Live Truck Tracking (Prototype)

* Delivery‑style garbage truck movement on map
* Route visualization
* Status updates:

  * Truck Scheduled
  * Entering Ward
  * Near Your House

### 🔔 Notification Alerts (Simulated)

* Website notifications when truck approaches
* Reduces missed garbage pickups

### 📈 Ward Health Score

* Cleanliness score (0–100)
* Based on participation and pickup consistency
* Encourages community involvement

### 👥 Citizen Participation Analytics

* Total registered households
* Active vs inactive users
* Participation visibility

### 🧾 Complaints & Feedback

* Structured complaint submission
* Citizen feedback system
